# Network Intrusion Detection using Decision Trees
- Programming Assignment for Elective Course CS 176 (Data Mining)
- Predictive decision tree model is used to detect computer network intrusion by classifying TCP records as either good or bad connections.
- C5.0 package in R to build and analyze decision trees, generate rulesets, and predict the labels (normal or attack) of a test dataset given the decision tree model of the training set.

# Objectives
The objectives of this Programming Assignment are as follows:
- To write R code that uses C5.0 algorithm to generate a decision tree model of the training set in `kddcup_data_10 percent.csv` containing TCP records, to analyze the generated decision tree, and to report the accuracy of its classification
- To write R code that generates rules for the training set in `kddcup_data_10 percent.csv` and to interpret these rules
- To predict the labels (normal or attack) of the test set containing unlabeled TCP connections in `kddcup_testingData_unlabeled_10 percent.csv` and report its accuracy
- To gain a deeper understanding of data mining through classification and to apply the predictive model to a real world application, namely network intrusion detection.
